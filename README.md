# Prompto Happiness Simulator 2k17:

** I really wanted to make a Happiness Simulator for my favourite character from Final Fantasy, because let’s be honest – none of the characters get nearly enough hugs in the game, and I want them to be at least a little bit happy. **

** So I coded up a thing. It’s for free, nonprofit and a tribute work, just a little bit of fun for anyone who, like me, enjoyed the game and wants to put a smile on this boy’s face. **



## Attribution

Since this is fanwork, I cannot stress enough that it's non-commercial and intended as a tribute work, because I love this game to bits.

The storyline of this game is not to be regarded as canon, and it's not an attempt to represent the original creators, it's merely the result of a fan wanting to play in the rich worlds created by such talented people.

Content I created includes game assets - code (made using Ren'py, open source and available on Github), artwork, scripts and music.
